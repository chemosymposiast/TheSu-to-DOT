# Preset: Clean slate — versatile defaults for any TheSu document
# =============================================================================
# Use this for a fresh run with any TheSu XML. No filters, no document-specific
# IDs. Copy to settings_user.toml, then set paths.xml_name to your XML file
# (without .xml). Output goes to _thesu_outputs/ using xml_name as basename.
#
# All settings you can change are in this file. You do NOT need to edit any
# Python code.
#
# Sections: [paths], [filters], [output], [layout], [system], [colors]
#
# Editing tips:
#   - Lines starting with # are comments (ignored). You can add your own.
#   - Use true/false (lowercase) for on/off switches.
#   - Use quotes for text: "my_value"
#   - For lists, use square brackets: ["item1", "item2"]
#   - Do not add trailing commas.
